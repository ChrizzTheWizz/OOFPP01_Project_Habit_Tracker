# OOFPP01_Project_Habit_Tracker
This Habit Tracker app is designed to help keep track of self-set goals. Activities that are to become regular habits can be created and evaluated.  This app was developed as part of a portfolio assignment for my Data Science degree and contains the basic requirements according to the assignment. Further development is not planned.
